# Perfana

**Perfana** is an open source performance observability platform designed to automate the validation, visualization, and reporting of performance test results. It empowers teams to continuously monitor performance trends and enforce performance goals during the software delivery lifecycle.

Perfana integrates seamlessly with popular test tools (like Gatling, JMeter, and k6), CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring systems (such as Grafana and Dynatrace), making it easy to shift performance testing left and catch regressions early.

## Key Features
* Automated validation of performance metrics using configurable thresholds
* Rich visualization and dashboards for test runs using Grafana
* Time series comparison between test runs
* Integration with CI pipelines: Use Perfana as quality gate
* Automated configuration of Grafana dashboards base on profiles / metric discovery
